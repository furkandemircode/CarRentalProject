# Car Rental Project

**Description:**

This is a backend application for a car rental service developed with .NET Core. The project is divided into five distinct layers to ensure a clean and maintainable architecture.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Entities:** Contains the data models used throughout the application. This layer defines the core objects and their properties.

2. **DataAccess:** Manages data access using Entity Framework Core. It handles interaction with the database and includes repositories for CRUD operations.

3. **Core:** Contains shared components and utilities that can be used across various projects. This layer is independent of the car rental project.

4. **Business:** Contains the business logic and rules of the application. This layer processes data and enforces business rules.

5. **WebAPI:** Provides the core API endpoints for the car rental service. This API connects to the [Car Rental Project - Frontend](https://github.com/furkandemircode/CarRentalProject-Frontend).

**Additional Information:**

This project was developed as part of the training process provided by [Kodlama.io](https://www.kodlama.io/courses/enrolled/1235979). It is one of the projects created during the training camp.
